Four Bar Trajectory Optimization 
Copyright 2017 The MathWorks, Inc.

Models a four bar linkage in Simscape Multibody.  The lengths
of the links are parameterized using MATLAB variables.  Adjusting
those lengths enables the tip of the four bar linkage to follow
different trajectories. Using optimization algorithms, the
lengths can be automatically tuned so that the tip follows a 
desired trajectory.
